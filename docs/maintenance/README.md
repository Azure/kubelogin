## How to Release

To make a new release and publish please follow the following steps.

1. Create a branch `publish-x.y.z`
2. Add a section to `CHANGELOG.md` with the header `## [x.y.z]` (N.B: make sure to write the new version in square brackets as the `changelog-reader` action only works if the `CHANGELOG.md` file follows the [Keep a Changelog standard](https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog))
3. Create a new PR, get approval and merge
4. Run the `release` workflow manually from the GH Actions tab

### In Event of Special Case Failures Post Build and Release.

In an event where build and release were successful but publish failed for something else, in that case please make sure we delete the unsucessful release note and release tag, before re-running the release again, this will get release fresh release notes and tag.
